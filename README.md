# Flex [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexandrevicenzi/Flex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alexandrevicenzi/Flex)

The minimalist [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) theme.

I forked this theme to slightly adapted it for my own needs. The most significant change is the way social links work. You can now specify a [line-awesome](https://icons8.com/line-awesome) symbol instead of being limited to certain brands. I did this with zero knowledge of *anything* related to web development, so I suggest you think very hard on whether you want to use this repo randomly. I suggest you use the upstream version and try adapt that yourself...
